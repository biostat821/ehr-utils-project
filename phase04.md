# Feature Request - age at first admission

Add a function that computes the age of a given patient _when their earliest lab was recorded_. The function signature is up to you - make good choices.
    
This is our first additional feature! Whenever you add a new feature:
* You may choose to tweak how the data are parsed and structured.
* Add tests.
* Update the documentation.
